A note on the feature matrices supplied:

- Each row of the Excel files supplied contains feature values (of features whose names are mentioned in the corresponding columns) computed over a two-second bout of tri-axial acceleration. All three Excel files have the same number of rows, and the same row number refers to the same two-second bout of tri-axial acceleration across the three files.

- The feature names for the "standard features" are explained in detail in the file "SuppInfo_Appendices"; those for the "biomechanical features" are explained in the main paper.

- In each Excel file, the second-last column contains the video-labels for each two-second bout of acceleration. 1: vigilance; 2: resting; 3: foraging; 4: running

- The last column contains the individual number for which two-second bouts of acceleration were collected. Data were collected on 11 individuals, so the last column contains integer values from 1 to 11.
